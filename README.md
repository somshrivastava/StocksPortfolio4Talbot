## Description

This project was built for a high school history class competition that my teacher, Mr. Talbot was hosting. Each student "invested" $1,000 in three stocks, and the app tracked whose portfolio performed best over a month. It was designed to make learning about markets and investing fun and interactive. Stocks Portfolio is a web application for tracking, simulating, and visualizing stock portfolios. Built with Angular and Firebase, it allows users to create portfolios, monitor stock performance, and view real-time profit/loss calculations.
